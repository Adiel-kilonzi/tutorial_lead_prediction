we don't have ordinal data I will not show how to convert it in this tutorial. You can read more on the _apply()_ and the _replace()_ methods which are useful when transforming ordinal data into numerical format since the hierarchy matters. Let me also mention the _OneHotEncoder()_ from _sklearn.preprocessing_ which is powerful especially in data pipelines. In categorical mostly one will use the _pd.get_dummies()_ this method takes each of the unique value of the specified columns and creates a new column with a boolean indicating whether the value was there (1) or not (0). If that doesn't make sense you will see it in action below and it will become clear. One thing we should watch out for is the **Dummy variable trap**. This happens when we have variables that are so correlated one could easily predict the other and it ends up as noise in our model. Let us first examine the results of our dummy encoding. The _pd.set_option(\"display.max_columns\", 100)_ Just says we want to see 100 columns you will see why that is

you can easily sea what I said, The gender column for example had 2 Values (Male, Female) now each of those values has its own column with a boolean (1,0) indicating if it was true or not. When it comes to things like region code which was nominal data this is not a problem, However when it comes to boolean this is a big problem leading to what we called the **Dummy variable trap**. It is easy again to spot in our Gender variable. The 'Gender_Female' column is the exact opposite of the 'Gender_Male' column. This means they hold the exact same information to a machine learning algorithm and are just redundant. For this reason for all Binary we will drop one field. Another thing to not is that in our case we also had another category for NaN (blank values) created cause we wanted to treat 'Credit_Product' with null differently. We will need to drop it for all other categories before feeding our data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":22,"id":"a7a653a9","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.313703Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.312327Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.370238Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.370802Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-18T12:34:22.532876Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.113726,"end_time":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.370994","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.257268","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style

We have the quantitative data which are integers in our case, but may also as well have included float. Machine learning algorithms work well with data that is in the same range. When we did our _df_train.describe()_ we got to see the Minimum and Maximum values. Our range can be defined as the numbers in between:\n","\n","Age - Minimum was 23 And Maximum was 85 meaning the **Range =  59**\n","\n","Vintage Minimum was 7 and Maximum was 135 meaning the **Range = 128** \n","\n","Avg_Account_Balance Minimum was 20,790  Maximum was 10,352,010 meaning the **Range = 10,331,220**\n","\n","Looking at the range we notice that 'Age'has a very small range of 59, 'Vintage' has nearly double the 'Age' range. Account Balance however supercedes all ranges. This is normal since we are usually measuring things with different units of measurement. So how do we solve this problem? by normalization. Normalisation converts any range to values between 0 to 1 (If the attribute has negative values the range changes from -1 to 1). There is a tool from scikit-learn that can do our transformations for us called _MinMaxScaler()_ it basically does the math for us and our data frame. We need to initialize an object, fit our current dataset then transform. The data it returns is a numpy array which we again convert back to a dataframe\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":23,"id":"b6ad13f8","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.556683Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.555642Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.907239Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.907773Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-18T12:34:56.598934Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.400428,"end_time":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.907961","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-11-18T14:26:39.507533","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style

Why I say one cycle is that more often than not we have to go through various algorithms, tune parameters for our algorithm and drop some columns(features). This was a small dataset so random forest works well for feature identification. There are other methods like forward and backward feature selection.
